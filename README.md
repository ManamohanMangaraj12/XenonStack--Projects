### bootstrap4_login

A simple _login-logout_ template built with:

*   [`php`](https://secure.php.net/index.php)
*   [`bootstrap v4`](https://getbootstrap.com/)
*   [`MySQL`](https://www.mysql.com/)
*   [`jquery`](https://jquery.com/)

<center></center>

### Notes

*   This is just a simple login-logout template that **has not** been fully security-tested and it has just been used for a university project of mine.
*   `mysqli_connect.php` should be stored in a path that is not accessable by public for security reasons.
*   Don't forget to change the default creds in _bootstrap4_login/creds_db.sql_
